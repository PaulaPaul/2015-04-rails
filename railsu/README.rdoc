Rails U:  Rails University

This is a sample application used in teaching introductory Ruby on Rails programming, and is loosely modeled after the Microsoft ASP.NET MVC 5 with Entity Framework 6 sample application: Contoso University.

The 'class notes' with step by step instructions assumes the student is using a free Rails enviornment courtesty of Nitrous.io, but this code will run in locally installed Rails enviornments as well.

See the PDF file with class notes for details-
Quesitons, comments and pull requests are welcome!
